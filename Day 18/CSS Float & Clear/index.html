                <div class="card">The Dark Knight (2008), directed by Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic masterpiece that redefined the superhero genre.
                Set in Gotham City, the film follows Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) as Batman, who, alongside Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary
                Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), strives to dismantle organized crime. However, their efforts
                are challenged by the arrival of the Joker (Heath Ledger), a chaotic and anarchic criminal mastermind who thrives on
                sowing fear and disorder. The Joker's unpredictable nature and twisted philosophy push Batman to his limits, forcing him
                to confront the moral complexities of justice, sacrifice, and the fine line between heroism and vigilantism.
                
                Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is iconic, earning him a posthumous Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His
                performance is chilling, capturing the character's madness, intelligence, and nihilistic worldview. The film delves into
                themes of duality, as seen in Harvey Dent's transformation into Two-Face, a tragic figure consumed by vengeance. The
                narrative is intense and thought-provoking, exploring the cost of fighting evil and the sacrifices required to maintain
                hope in a world teetering on the edge of chaos.
                
                Nolan's direction, combined with Wally Pfister's stunning cinematography and Hans Zimmer's haunting score, creates a
                dark, immersive atmosphere. The action sequences are gripping, from the opening bank heist to the high-stakes chase
                scenes and the climactic showdown. The Dark Knight is not just a superhero film; it's a profound exploration of human
                nature, morality, and the enduring struggle between order and chaos. Its impact on pop culture and the genre remains
                unparalleled, solidifying its place as one of the greatest films of all time.</div>
